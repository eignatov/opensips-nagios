openSIPS Nagios Plugin
Installation Instructions


Introduction
------------

The host on which the opensips script should be run must provide the
opensipsctl program which is usually included by openSIPS. This script allows
to query the current state of the openSIPS server.
Usually the script resides in /usr/local/bin/opensips/sbin/opensipsctl
In any other case the opensips script needs to be updated and the correct
location of opensips must be configured in $OPENSIPSCTL.

If you want to have an extended howto describing the installation and
configuration of Nagios please use their documentation (or $searchengine).
This part briefly describes the configuration of Nagios if you want to add
this script to your environment.

For the rest of this document, we use the term Nagios server for the computer
runs the Nagios monitoring tools and the term Nagios client which denotes the
machine running openSIPS (which we want to monitor).


Nagios Client
-------------
1. First we need to install the opensips script to each host which should be
monitored. It needs to be installed to /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/
If the client is able to access the internet the most recent version of
the opensips script can be easily fetched by calling:
	wget https://raw.github.com/fallenbeck/opensips-nagios/master/opensips

2. NRPE needs to be configured correctly. NRPE will be called by Nagios so
we need to make the opensips script known to the service. This will be done
in the file /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg by adding some lines:
	command[opensips_users]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/opensips -M location-users -w 3 -c 10
	command[opensips_dialogs]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/opensips -M active_dialogs -w 3 -c 10
Which lines to add depents on your needs. You may query every metric supported
by opensipsctl (except udp-load) and you are free to specify the command name.
This name is important when setting up the Nagios server. You need to
remember it.

3. The NRPE service needs to be restarted to load its modified configuration:
	service nagios-nrpe-server restart
	(or: /etc/init.d/nagios-nrpe-server restart)


Nagios Server
-------------
1. We need to specify the host(s) we want to monitor. This is done in the
file /etc/nagios3/objects/hosts.cfg:
define host{
        use             linux-host
        host_name       opensips-1
        alias           OpenSIPS-1 server
        address         opensips-1
        hostgroups      debian-servers, ssh-servers, opensips-servers
}
define host{
        use             linux-host
        host_name       opensips-2
        alias           OpenSIPS-2 server
        address         opensips-2
        hostgroups      debian-servers, ssh-servers, opensips-servers
}

2. We need to define the hostgroup opensips-servers which has been used in 
the hosts definition above. This will be done in the file
/etc/nagios3/objects/hostgroups.cfg:
define hostgroup{
        hostgroup_name  opensips-servers
        alias           OpenSIPS Servers
}

3. We need to define the services we want to monitor. This will be done in
the file /etc/nagios3/objects/services.cfg:
define service{
        use                     generic-service
        hostgroup_name          opensips-servers
        service_description     Registered OpenSIPS Users
        check_command           check_nrpe_1arg!opensips_users
}
define service{
        use                     generic-service
        hostgroup_name          opensips-servers
        service_description     Active OpenSIPS Dialogs
        check_command           check_nrpe_1arg!opensips_dialogs
}
You need to define a service for each metric that you will display in the
Nagios dashboard. Please not that you provide the command name in the
check_command settings which you have defined on the Nagios Client earlier.

Finally, Nagios needs to be restarted. This can be done by calling
	service nagios3 restart
	(or: /etc/init.d/nagios3 restart)
